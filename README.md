autopkg-recipes
===============

My AutoPkg recipes have moved! They are now available at [jazzace-recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/jazzace-recipes) within the [AutoPkg project](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg). This makes them available with an 'autopkg search' on the command line. They focus mostly on feeding DeployStudio. To that end, I use a .ds suffix for such recipes.

Anything still lingering here is not production-ready; this is now a scratch space.
